Hey, I am Zexue Liu (Z. Liu). Welcome to my blog.

I completed my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree at  [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), specializing in the field of radio-frequency (RF) and analog integrated circuit design.

I considered myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the programming languages theories and implementations domain (i.e. compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection), and a creative technologiest deeply caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI and HCI in general.

I also worked on the [Hermes JavaScript Engine](https://hermesengine.dev/), some other projects under the [Reality Labs (Research)](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/), and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) (now [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)) efforts at Meta (Facebook).

In the past, I worked on [Alitrip (Fliggy)](https://www.alitrip.com/) mobile and web apps under the [Alibaba Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group), found and lead front-end infrastructure team at an unicorn startup company [Beijing Weiying (a.k.a. WePiao, now acquired by Maoyan)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology), and helped [Ele.me (now acquired by Alibaba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me) to upgrade their mobile web site into [the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China](https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509).

I studied BA, Digital Media Art at [Communication University of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China) and MS, Computer Science (with a focus on programming languages, mainly supervised by [Prof. Matthew Fluet](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/)) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology).
